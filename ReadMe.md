# Old code

## What?

Some of the oldest code I wrote and my initial use of github.

## Why?

Because I can't bring myself to delete it out of nostalgia.

## Files?

### V....pas

Pascal program written with the basic knowlege learnt in a highschool class.

Writes "Good morning Vietnam!" with as many "o"s as whatsapp allows in a single message.

This was my first use of programming as a tool to simplify my life.

### V....py

Similar program to the one above but in python.

This was one of my personal python tests. The difference between the execution times of both programs was interesting.

### Slow.py

At the time I had seen gameplay of a game called _Stories Untold_, more specifically, the first story, called _The House Abandon_. In the game, the player interacts with a computer. The inputs and outputs leave the computer with a natural delay which at the time I felt like I could replicate as an interesting challenge.
